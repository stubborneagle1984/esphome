Noise-C Library
===============

**Note**: This is a port of the [noise-c](https://github.com/rweather/noise-c) library to support 1. PlatformIO build system and 2. ESP8266/ESP32 targets.

Noise-C is a plain C implementation of the
[Noise Protocol](http://noiseprotocol.org), intended as a
reference implementation.  It can also be referred to as "Noisy",
which is what you get when you say "Noise-C" too fast.  The code is
distributed under the terms of the MIT license.

The [documentation](http://rweather.github.io/noise-c/index.html)
contains more information on the library, examples, and how to build it.

For more information on this library, to report bugs, to contribute,
or to suggest improvements, please contact the author Rhys Weatherley via
